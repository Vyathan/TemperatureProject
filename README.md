# Temperature Project

## Chapter 12, Intermediate 23, An Introduction to Programming with C++

If necessary, create a new project named Intermediate23 Project and save it in the Cpp8\Chap12 folder. Also create a new source file named Intermediate23.cpp. Declare a seven-row, two-column int array named temperatures. The program should prompt the user to enter the highest and lowest temperatures for seven days. Store the highest temperatures in the first column in the array. Store the lowest temperatures in the second column. The program should display the average high temperature and the average low temperature. Display the average temperatures with one decimal place. Save and then run the program. Test the program using the data shown in figure 12-19.
